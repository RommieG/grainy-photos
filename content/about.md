![Rom Gostomski, author](/img/rom-gostomski.jpg#center)

My name is Rom Gostomski, and I am a keen amateur photographer living in Andalucia, Spain. I am the author of this web site.

In 2017, my life changed dramatically. I moved to Spain with my wife and Chester, our springer spaniel (sadly no longer with us). After a lifetime of living and working in the UK, I needed a change and a new challenge. We had bought a holiday home in Spain a few years earlier, so things kind of fell into place… We just went for it; the daily commute to London was history.

Apart from photography, I also enjoy hill walking with my dog Flo, discovering Spain and designing websites. Flo (Florencia) was an abandoned puppy roaming the streets in our village here in Spain, scavenging for food. She was lovely but so thin! We took pity on her and took her in. She’s turning out OK!

## Photography

I have been interested in photography for as long as I can remember. I received my first camera, a Kodak Instamatic, when I was about ten. Back then, it was only film. My first SLR was a Pentax MX. It was supposed to be the legendary Pentax K1000, but it took me so long to save up enough money that Pentax released the MX, so I got that.

I went fully digital circa 2007 when I bought the Nikon D40X. Several more Nikon cameras followed, the last one being the Nikon Z6 mirrorless camera.

But the lure of film photography was always there, and in February 2020, I took it up again, using my original Pentax MX, which was still in perfect working order. More film cameras and a darkroom followed. I started posting my photos online on [tapasinthesun.com](https://www.tapasinthesun.com), switching to this site, grainyphotos.com, in 2024 to keep digital and film separate.
