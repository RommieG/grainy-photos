> *A sunny winter Sunday afternoon walking on the Via Verde near Alcaudete with my Mamia RB67 medium format film camera.*

I don’t shoot much colour film, but I have been trialling the new Harman Phoenix 200 film, which I developed and processed myself. I, therefore, had some colour chemistry available, so why not make the most of it? 

Therefore, with camera in hand, I took my dog Flo for a walk on the Via Verde, a disused network of railway lines, which have been converted into footpaths/cycle tracks. 

All the following photos were taken that day using a Mamiya RB67 camera with Porto 160 film. I developed the film myself using Tetenal ColourTec C41 chemistry at 30°C.
