> *Harman Phoenix 200 is a brand-new ISO 200, C41 colour negative film. With high contrast and strong, visible grain, it is characterful, unmistakeably analogue and produces results unlike any other colour film.*

## A new colour film is born

Harman released Phoenix 200 35mm colour film on 1 December 2023. Phoenix 200 is a 35mm colour negative C41 film, described by Harman as:

- High contrast
- Strong visible grain
- Punchy vibrant colours
- Possibility of halation
- Characterful
- Unmistakably analogue

Numerous videos were released on the day the film was released by YouTubers who had received advance rolls of Phoenix 200 to try.

The initial photos that I saw were very variable; a lot of them I just plain didn’t like. That made me curious. Why do the results vary so much? What is this film really like?

> *Harman Phoenix is an experimental, limited-edition film and the first step on our colour journey. Making colour films is very different to black & white and while we have made good progress, we recognise we have a lot more to learn. Please embrace this film for all its quirks and differences.*

Although I shoot very little colour film, I decided that I had to try this film. I also thought it was exciting that Harman had released a new colour film. Not repackaged, not rebranded, but brand new, developed from scratch. I had to be part of this… so I ordered three rolls.

## The plan

While I waited for the film to arrive, I looked at videos, studied photos and analysed what I liked and what I didn’t like. I had plenty of time because although a delivery time of 48 hours had been quoted, it took two weeks (presumably because of the pre-Christmas rush).

I preferred photos shot with the film rated at 100ish ISO. Simple compositions which filled the frame seemed to work better. But the key appeared to be avoid having the film scanned by a lab. DIY scans usually looked much better. So I ordered a Tetenal Colourtec C41 kit. I was going to do everything myself!

The film and chemistry arrived a few days before Christmas. I loaded my camera and went to shoot my first roll of Phoenix 200 film.

## Roll 2


## Conclusions

This film is like no other that I have used. It is:

- Contrasty
- Grainy
- Not very sharp
- Has a limited dynamic range – highlights blow out, and shadows lack detail
- No anti-halation layer

Nevertheless, it is a very interesting film. With careful choice of subject and colour and correct exposure, it is possible to get nice results.

It must be remembered that this is Harman’s first attempt at a colour film and the first newly developed colour film for decades. For that, I applaud them. This is an early release limited edition version; it is still in the experimental stage.

Where it goes from here is crucial. I await with great anticipation what the second release will bring.
